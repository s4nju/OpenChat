## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Bun (recommended)
- Git
- A Convex account (free tier available)
- API keys for the AI models you want to use

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ajanraj/OpenChat.git
cd OpenChat

# Install dependencies (using Bun - recommended)
bun install
```

### 2. Set up Convex Backend

OS Chat uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) for real-time backend, authentication, and database management.

```bash
# Login to Convex (creates account if needed)
bunx convex login

# Set up a new Convex project (this creates .env.local with Convex URLs)
bunx convex dev --once
```

This will:

- Create a new Convex project in your dashboard
- Generate a `convex/` directory with your schema
- Create a `.env.local` file with your Convex deployment URLs

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

**Important**: Convex creates `.env.local` with deployment URLs. Don't overwrite it!

Instead, copy the example file to see what other variables you need:

```bash
# View the example to see what API keys you need
cat .env.example

# Add the additional variables to your existing .env.local
# (Don't copy over - this would delete your Convex URLs!)
```

Manually add these to your existing `.env.local` file:

- AI model API keys (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, xAI, etc.)
- Analytics keys (PostHog, Umami)
- Search provider keys (Exa)
- Other configuration from `.env.example`

### 4. Set up Convex Configuration

Configure the required and optional Convex environment variables for your application.

#### A. Authentication (Required)

OS Chat uses Convex Auth for authentication with Google OAuth.

1. **Initialize Convex Auth:**

   ```bash
   # Initialize Convex Auth setup
   bunx @convex-dev/auth
   ```

2. **Set up Google OAuth:**

   - Follow the [Google OAuth Setup Guide](https://labs.convex.dev/auth/config/oauth/google)
   - Set your Google OAuth credentials in Convex:

   ```bash
   # Set Google OAuth credentials
   bunx convex env set AUTH_GOOGLE_ID your-google-client-id
   bunx convex env set AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET your-google-client-secret
   ```

3. **Set Required Environment Variables:**

   ```bash
   # Generate and set API key encryption secret in Convex (REQUIRED)
   bunx convex env set API_KEY_SECRET $(openssl rand -hex 64)

   # Set site URL for development
   bunx convex env set SITE_URL http://localhost:3000
   ```

#### B. Cloudflare R2 Storage (Required for file uploads)

OS Chat uses Cloudflare R2 for file attachments and image storage.

1. **Create a Public Cloudflare R2 Bucket:**

   - Sign up for a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
   - Navigate to R2 Object Storage in your dashboard
   - Create a new bucket (e.g., `oschat-files`)
   - **Important**: Configure the bucket for public access:
     - Go to Settings > Public Access
     - Enable "Allow public access"
     - Set up a custom domain or use the R2.dev subdomain
   - Configure CORS to allow GET and PUT requests from your domain

2. **Generate R2 API Credentials:**

   - Go to R2 > Manage R2 API tokens
   - Create a new API token with Object Read & Write permissions
   - Save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

3. **Set R2 Environment Variables in Convex:**

   ```bash
   # Required R2 configuration
   bunx convex env set R2_BUCKET your-bucket-name
   bunx convex env set R2_TOKEN your-r2-api-token
   bunx convex env set R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID your-access-key-id
   bunx convex env set R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY your-secret-access-key
   bunx convex env set R2_ENDPOINT https://your-account-id.r2.cloudflarestorage.com

   # Required: Public URL for serving files
   # Use your custom domain or R2.dev subdomain
   bunx convex env set R2_PUBLIC_URL_BASE https://your-bucket.your-domain.com/
   # or
   # bunx convex env set R2_PUBLIC_URL_BASE https://pub-xxxxx.r2.dev/
   ```

#### C. Polar Payments (Optional)

```bash
# Set Polar environment variables (optional)
bunx convex env set POLAR_ORGANIZATION_TOKEN your-polar-organization-token
bunx convex env set POLAR_PREMIUM_PRODUCT_ID your-product-id
bunx convex env set POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET your-polar-webhook-secret
```

### 5. Deploy Convex Functions

Deploy your Convex schema and functions:

```bash
# Deploy to Convex (this pushes your functions and schema)
bunx convex deploy

# Or for development with hot reload
bunx convex dev
```

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
# Start the Next.js development server
bun dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see oschat running locally!

### 7. Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. **Deploy Convex**:

   ```bash
   bunx convex deploy --prod
   ```

2. **Deploy Frontend** (Vercel recommended):

   ```bash
   # Install Vercel CLI
   bun add -g vercel

   # Deploy to Vercel
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Update Environment Variables**:
   - Add your production API keys to Vercel
   - Update `SITE_URL` in Convex production dashboard to your production URL

### Troubleshooting

**Convex Connection Issues**:

- Ensure you're logged into Convex: `bunx convex login`
- Check your deployment URL in `.env.local`
- Run `bunx convex dev` to sync functions

**Authentication Issues**:

- Verify OAuth credentials in Convex dashboard
- Check `SITE_URL` matches your development/production URL
- Ensure Convex Auth is properly configured

**API Key Issues**:

- Verify API keys are correctly set in `.env.local`
- Check API key permissions and quotas

**File Upload Issues**:

- Ensure R2 bucket is configured for public access
- Verify R2_PUBLIC_URL_BASE is set correctly with trailing slash
- Check CORS settings allow your domain
- Confirm all R2 environment variables are set in Convex
